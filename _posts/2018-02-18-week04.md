# Debugging
There has been some debate over the issue I had claimed so I am still waiting to be assigned my issue. 

# Code Triage Experiences

This week, I signed up to two different projects on Code Triage. 

I signed up to [guides](https://www.codetriage.com/freecodecamp/guides) which is described as a collection of easy-to-understand guides to programming tools. I thought that this might offer a gentle introduction to fixing open source issues since the problems range from editing indentations to clarifying language. 

I found that a lot of the issues were content based - people wanted to create new posts that addressed different topics such as Markup languages and Android App Development, and these had to then be submitted.I found some interesting, such as adding book recommendations:

I liked this issue since it seems that is a group that allows people to contribute their own ideas and there’s room for personal additions.  However, some are lacking description, such as:

Overall, there seems to be a mix of grammatical and language issues as well as content edits.


The second guide I signed up for is [Electron](https://www.codetriage.com/electron/electron). This builds cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I chose this because I have some experience with frontend apps that uses these languages and would like to learn about the Electron framework. 

The issues seem to be pretty advanced and require a high level of knowledge to fix. For example, **Check failed: *base_computed_style_ == *computed_style#11949**.

However, the issue was clearly stated with the steps to reproduce the bug outlined. The user later solved their own problem and commented the answer which I thought was very helpful and good practice. Similarly, this was the template used in another issue; App.Dock is not working;

Overall, users seem to add tags to issues which I think makes the categories obvious and will help if I want to choose an issue to help with. 

I like both of these repositories and hope to be able to contribute to them in the future!
