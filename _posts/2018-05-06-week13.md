### Reflections on Course
Through this class I was introduced to the open source community. 
Previously, I had never interacted or even considered contributing to this diverse and exciting 
community. I thought that the course offered a interesting insight into open source and I enjoyed the 
scope of the class which included both practical training, for Git and version control, as well as 
the more abstract questions of what open source offers us. I liked that the class incorporated both. 

I did not like the amount of class time that was dedicated to our group projects, it felt like we spent 
too much time in class working on them as opposed to the course.

If possible, I would add more speakers to the course, as I really enjoyed learning about the open source applications to the real world and how many of the engineers found their starts.
