# Questions for Danna
1. How does Google maintain their open source community?
2. On Google's website it says that Open Source is about making a "better world" how do you think the company achieves this?
3. What is the coolest open source project at Google currently?

# Team Progress
This week we met to discuss how we plan to move forward and fulfill our goal of contributing to the Brackets Open Sourc project. We have all individually read through the documentation and have found that the community is fairly inactive and also what issues do exist are fairly advanced. We would like to see if there are any bugs that we could take on. We haven't yet assigned specific tasks but we will do at our next meeting.

Additionally, we're also considering building a plugin as this maybe a more viable option for contributing to this project. By our next meeting we are going to each present our ideas for one.

# Contributions this week

This week I submitted one issue with [Zander](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/aif228-weekly) on Github and also another issue on Wikipedia:
