## Editing a Wikipedia Article

### How I selected the article:

Initially, I tried to find Wikipedia articles that needed editing, however, I was unable to do so. So instead, I edited 
one of Wikipedia's suggested articles. The first one offered was VocÃª Decide - a Brazilian television show that had 
been translated from Portugeuse. 

### Contribution that I made:
I just contributed to the introduction; the sentence structure was quite poor, so I rearranged some of the sentences and
edited the grammar.
